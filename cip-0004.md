# Abstract

Establishes a protocol for issuing subassets 

(_ex._ `PIZZA`, `PIZZA.DOMINOS`, `PIZZA.DOMINOS.COUPON`, `PIZZA.Dominos.Coupon!`)

# Motivation

To enable named asset owners the ability and flexibility to issue new easily identified and related named assets.

# Definitions

asset

    A named asset which acts as PARENT to a subasset

subasset

    A numeric asset which is a CHILD of a named asset

longname

    A alphabetical string which indicates the full subasset name (_ex._ PIZZA.DOMINOS, PIZZA.dominos, PIZZA.DoMiNoS.Coupon )


# Specifications
1. Subasset names must meet following requirements :
    *   1 to 250 characters in length (ie. PIZZA.X or PIZZA.REALLY-long-VALID-Subasset-NAME)
    *   Contain only characters : a-zA-Z0-9.-_@!
    *   Cannot start or end with a period (.)
    *   Cannot contain multiple consecutive periods (..)

2. Subasset can only be issued from same address that owns the parent asset at the time of the issuance.
3. Subasset can be transferred to a new owner address after initial issuance (if necessary)

# Changes

## Database
1. Add asset_longname TEXT UNIQUE field to Assets table

## Issuances
Given the example of asset PIZZA and subasset PIZZA.DOMINOS `counterparty-lib` would require the following changes: 

1. When validating a subasset issuance attempt `(issuance.validate)`:
    - Verify that issuing address is owner of PIZZA asset.
    - Verify that PIZZA.DOMINOS does not already exist by checking asset_longname for PIZZA.DOMINOS

2. When issuing a valid subasset `(issuance.compose)`:
    - Issue numeric asset and set description to EXISTING DESCRIPTION + 3b3b6C50495a5a412e444f4d494e4f53
    ```
    (hex) 3b3b6C50495a5a412e444f4d494e4f53
    (text) ;;lPIZZA.DOMINOS

    ;; = marks start of key/value pairs
    l  = longname

    PIZZA.DOMINOS = long asset name
    ```
3. When parsing/reparsing issuance transactions `(issuance.parse)`:
    - After block X, description.split('3b3b') to get name/value pairs. If name/value pairs are present
        1. decode name/value pairs from hex to text
        2. parse in longname
        3. create issuance record
        4. update Assets table to set asset_longname to longname value

## API
1. When making requests to get asset information `(get_issuances & get_asset_info)`:
    - return new asset_longname value (if any)
