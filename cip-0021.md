## Abstract ##

A mechanism to swap tokens for on-chain BTC without the need for a third signed
message, unlike BTCPay which needs interaction to honor the match, hence
introducing counterparty risk.

## Motivation ##

BTCPay messages for token trading are a UX mess: a user need to create a message
that expresses the willingness to exchange BTC for a token, the second user then
escrows the token to this message and then the first user must send the required
BTC to the escrowing user to finish the exchange.

Granted, this feature has seen little use due to this complicated arrangement.
This also creates a scenario where people can avoid honoring the escrowing user
with the BTC send, creating a counterparty risk where an address can lose the
tx fee and in a worse scenario, via blockchain timeout, the honored BTC.

## Rationale ##

Having a mechanism which gives out a fixed amount of tokens for a given amount
of on-chain BTC solves the scenario where the escrowing party doesn't needs to
rely on the buyer to honor a previous intent.

"Dispensers" just dispense tokens equivalent to fixed quantities of BTC received
by an address, removing the need for order matching with BTC (which can't be
escrowed on-chain). Excess BTC shouldn't be sent by the buying party as the
seller doesn't has motivation to honor back this remnant.

## Technical implementation ##

A new message type under the CIP11 numbering should be allocated for address
sweep messages.

The dispenser must specify the following fields:

  * New Message ID: ````0x0C````
  * Asset Id of the given out asset
  * The given quantity of the asset to put on the dispenser
  * The amount of the asset to give on each swap
  * The satoshi rate to unit of token given out
  * The state of the dispenser (0 open, 10 closed)

Dispensers can enter a drained status (state 20). This state is reached when the
dispenser has greater than 0 balance, but not enough to do more swaps.

In this state they can be refilled by reopening (in which case the remaining
balance will be added to the new escrowed balance) or closed (in which case the
remaining balance will leave escrow and get back to the source address).

# API Changes

### create_sweep

`create_dispenser` creates a sweep message:

 * **asset** : The address receiving the assets and/or ownerships.
 * **ops**: 8-bit mask of the operations to be done

### get_dispensers

gets the dispensers from the database, in the same manner as other get_* ops.
