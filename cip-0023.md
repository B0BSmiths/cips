## Abstract ##

Fix the issue when creating dividends where the payment is done with non-divisible
assets over a divisible asset. Also, change the protocol to not write 0 quantity
dividend credits.

## Motivation ##

Payouts of dividends of non-divisible assets is broken and non-functional because
of a bug in the handling of divisibility information at the moment of handing out
the credits.

## Rationale ##

Several projects in the Counterparty ecosystem are using this characteristic to
distribute newly minted collectibles to holders of a certain bearer token,
rendering the potentiality of this feature useless as distributing a non divisible
asset over a divisible asset almost never works as expected.

## Technical implementation ##

Fixing `dividend.py` on the validate and parse sections to properly calculate
amounts for this kind of transactions.

# API Changes
