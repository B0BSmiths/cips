## Abstract ##

A modification to the dispensers mechanism to allow a standard dispenser to change
price automatically based on an external feed that acts as an oracle.

## Motivation ##

Usage of dispensers has opened up a lot of possibilities for counterparty users,
letting the exchange of tokens for bitcoin flow more freely. However, the price
assigned to a dispenser is fixed to the given bitcoin amount when opening it,
making price swings problematic for dispenser offerings.

Oracled dispensers would allow pegging the value of a dispenser to a variable
feed multiplier, letting users specify the price of a given dispenser to a
multiplier of a feed.

## Rationale ##

Allowing users to fix a price to an external oracle would allow pegging token
offerings to "real world" assets, allowing sensible prices for long term things
like share selling, token packs and bundles. Usually pegging the value of a
token to a "real world" asset incurs contrived mechanisms like stablecoins or
rebasing of a coin supply. Having a way to easily fix the price of a dispenser
to an external ticker completely removes the need of these schemes that are
prone to manipulation and user confusion.

## Technical implementation ##

Two different parts need to be implemented.

 1) a mechanism to publish feeds that represent price pegging, with these feeds
 getting somehow paid by the users.
 2) a new type of dispenser opening where instead of a fixed bitcoin price, it
 refers to the feeds on point 1 and a multiplier of those feeds.

For this to work, a well known address publishes periodics updates to the feeds
via a broadcast. These updates can be done with a frequency at the sole
discretion of the feed operator.

Whenever a BTC payment reaches a dispenser address, it gets compared to the
latest fee price multiplied by the dispenser amount (if the dispenser if oracled).
If there's a price match then the tokens get dispensed.

Usage of the dispensers can be bound to a subscription service, due to the fact
that operating them costs transactions fees to the operators. Feed operators can
assign a certain asset that needs to be paid to their feed to be used by
dispenser addresses. This usage fee can be determined at their sole discretion
and will be required to be paid on a regular basis determined by the feeds
operators (from a minimum of 144 blocks to MAX_INT blocks, or the special value
of Infinity, which would require only one payment). The asset required by the
feed and amount is also setup via broadcast and can be set at any time.

Feed payments are made by sending the corresponding asset and amount to the
feed address in multiples of the cost periods with the dispenser address as a
memo for the payment being made. If the feed pricing/asset changes, the previous
feed payments get grandfathered in.

Dispenses from oracled dispensers that don't have a time allotment will be
withheld until the time allotment gets paid, preventing thus an scenario where a
user pays for the tokens but due to lack of payment the dispenser won't dispense.

After time allotment payment, all the withheld dispenses will be released to the
users in one operation.

Time allotment increase the block usability of the feeds since dispenser creation
to avoid feature exploitation/abuse. This means that payment of the feed usage is
cumulative and not indicative.

# API Changes

### create_dispenser

`create_dispenser` needs changes to allow creating dispensers linked to an oracle.
New types of dispenser open types will be created to differentiate the type of
dispenser being created (between usual dispensers or oracled dispensers).

### create_broadcast

`create_broadcast` needs a new type of broadcast for the price and feed payment
messages. The new type should be able to include:
  * Feed usage price (8 bytes uint)
  * Feed usage asset (8 bytes asset ID)
  * Feed usage time allotment per payment (4 bytes uint), valid values are between
  144 and MAX_INT and the special value 0 which means infinity.
  * External price (8 bytes uint)
  * External asset name (Always as tail of the broadcast)
All the fields are optional, and are enabled in a bitfield mask at the start of
the broadcast message. Having no fields is invalid. The order of the fields is
always the same, regardless if they are enabled or not.

# Database Changes

* `feed_state` table with the timestamped information of the prices and latest
cost and asset for feed usage.

* `feed_payments` table with the latest feed payments.

## Backwards Compatibility ##

The oracled dispensers will be a consensus change that will activate at a specific block to be determined after implementation. All parsing servers will need to upgrade before this block to maintain consensus.
