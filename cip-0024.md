## Abstract ##

A modification to the dispensers mechanism to allow a standard dispenser to change
price automatically based on an external feed that acts as an oracle.

## Motivation ##

Usage of dispensers has opened up a lot of possibilities for counterparty users,
letting the exchange of tokens for bitcoin flow more freely. However, the price
assigned to a dispenser is fixed to the given bitcoin amount when opening it,
making price swings problematic for dispenser offerings.

Oracled dispensers would allow pegging the value of a dispenser to a variable
feed multiplier, letting users specify the price of a given dispenser to a
multiplier of a feed.

## Rationale ##

Allowing users to fix a price to an external oracle would allow pegging token
offerings to "real world" assets, allowing sensible prices for long term things
like share selling, token packs and bundles. Usually pegging the value of a
token to a "real world" asset incurs contrived mechanisms like stablecoins or
rebasing of a coin supply. Having a way to easily fix the price of a dispenser
to an external ticker completely removes the need of these schemes that are
prone to manipulation and user confusion.

## Technical implementation ##


# API Changes

### create_dispenser

`create_dispenser` needs changes to allow creating dispensers linked to an oracle.
