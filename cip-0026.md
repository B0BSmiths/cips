## Abstract ##

Current database implementation for Counterparty uses an underlying Sqlite
embedded database. This has proven to be problematic in certain scenarios,
mainly due to long startup times and to difficulty of database interaction
in deep integration scenarios. Migrating the whole Counterparty database
to a more approachable RDBMS will boost adoption of the system by leveraging
well known tools for integrators in the event of adoption.
